# Technetium - wicked fast Android testing

Technetium is an open-source Android testing tool which lets you write and modify test cases without having to spend precious minutes re-compiling and deploying your whole Android project after every small change. 

Highlights include:
* Built-in support for the [Robotium](https://github.com/jayway/robotium) framework, allowing you to write Selenium-style tests which can interact with your application's UI in rich ways.
* The ability to write tests in JavaScript, allowing for creating simple tests which can be written and re-written without ever having to re-compile your app.
* Full integration with the existing Android testing paradigms, so you can still run Technetium tests using whatever method you used to run your Activity Instrumentation tests previously.
* Change and re-run a given test in less than a second.
